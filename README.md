📖About:
This is an app my team and I built for the School of Code mid-bootcamp frontend project. It is a notes/resources organiser designed specifically to meet the needs of School of Code bootcampers. This project came about through our group identifying a pain point of the course being the lack of a central place to store notes and resources gathered during the course in relation to each week. This has the added benefit of functioning as a curricululum overview. Keep in mind that we had not covered the back end or deployment yet so therefor this is strictly a front-end project.

🖥️Tech-stack:
The app was built in React with React router performing the route handling. Styling was done without the use of a UI library- simple CSS.

🚀Run:
This repo can be cloned down to your local machine using either the HTTPS or SSH prococols. It can be run on a local server with 'npm run' in the terminal.
